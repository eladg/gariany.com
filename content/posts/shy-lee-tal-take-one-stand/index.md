## Music: Shy-Lee Tal - Take One Stand

[Shy-Lee Tal](https://www.instagram.com/shyleetalmusic/) is this one of these amazing artists you know will make big impact with their art. I met Shy-Lee Traveling in India and we spent literally weeks jamming, hanging and singing our favorite songs together.

This, beleive it or now, was one of the first recorded performances she did and I'm so happy I was able to contribute my [Rytm Beats]({{< ref "/tags/elektron" >}}) to it. Shout out to Shimon Ben-David on guitar, Nahdi on bass, Itzik on percussion and the rest of Kudli Beach friends üèñ

You can checkout Shy-Lee Tal's [Facebok page](https://www.facebook.com/shyleetalmusic) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shyleetalmusic/). Love you Shy-Lee!
