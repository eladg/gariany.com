You can't touch this fire, it is so wild and graceful in me. You won't feel how it burns, but you might see some of my trees falling.

You can't touch this blood, it bubbles deep in me. Sheer and unintentional force of flow carving through my rocky mountains.

You can't touch this air, just feed your divine breath in me. Feeding my soul with love, to break free from the mud.

You can't penetrate this space, without me inviting you over. Ahalan Wa-Sahalan. These paths and walls are being built here for many years, step by step and brick by brick.

And for all that is missing, be my grounding. Burning down, carving through and bursting a new path. Forever falling into happiness. You can't touch this fire, but if you dare to, it will.
