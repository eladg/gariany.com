## Audio: Elektron Rytm Live Jam Early March 2017

The following is a recorded jam straight out of my Elektron Rytm MKI machine. This machine is by far my fav. music instrument ever created. It's amazing how with a couple of knobs turn you can trun a simple sample into a repeating musical phrase the listener can 'tune in' to.

This is not intended to be a produced music material, just a jam with my sampler. There are certenly a lot of ruff edges "not pleasant" to listen to, but I like this little piece of memory.
