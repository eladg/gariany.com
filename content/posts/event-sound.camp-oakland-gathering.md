# SOUND:CAMP Collective - Fall 2020 Acustic Gathering

Had an amazing time hosting the SOUND:CAMP Collective Fall 2020 Acustic Gathering in our backyard. We had 7 live performers and a full 2 hours jam with all of our friends playing timeless gems.

I was able to capture 5:30 hours of music out of \~9 hours music event (Epic!).

Here it is:
