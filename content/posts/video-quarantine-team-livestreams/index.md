## Video: Quarantine Team Livestreams

Almost every Shabbat Eve, my friends and I get together for a traditional Jewish service and a musical jam. I am so greatful to be living in a house surrounded by musicians.

On this random Friday eve we streamed jamming for 2.5 hours. Such a blessing in this crazy Covid-19 Times to be living in isolation with this amazing people!

Here are some of the videos we captured during these times :)
