## üî• WOW! Tiny Desk Standout Submission For 'The Fountain (El Hamaayan)'

As a music composer, it is pretty rare to get recognition for a musical piece you write. Similar to, say architecture, it is pretty rare that a piece is even comes into fruition. Beyond the arrangement of a big band and finalizing every note in the piece, there are so many obstacles in the way to success. For that, I'm extreamly lucky to have a group of musician I work and play with regularly. A group that was willing to work on my very strange piece and make it into a product. A group that choose to take my work and produce a music video for it, while I was building a music studio in the Himalayas.

So proud of The Rabbit Hole Orchestra and my music partner 'Benny Langfur' for making it happen, I'm extreamly honored that my piece was recognized by  'Tiny Desk' - one of the coolest music competision in the US.

> In The Rabbit Hole Orchestra's entry video for "The Fountain", the band members' confidence is bursting from their animal onesies and Hawaiian shirts. Hearing the nine-piece psychedelic funk band feels metaphysical from the start. The video, filmed by Marco Antonelli, starts casually with bandmates laughing in camaraderie, like an open invitation to join their safe space. Then, midway into the track, the strings, synths, brass and drums melt into the fuzzy visuals with ease. "The Fountain" is a mix textured in its own decadent groove. ‚ÄîJacqueline Reed
