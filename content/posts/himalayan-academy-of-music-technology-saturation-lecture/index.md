I had such a blast talking to artists, musicians and creators from all around the world.

On my spring break of 2018, I was invited by [Himalayan Academy of Music Technology](https://www.facebook.com/HAMT.Education/) in Mcleod Ganj (Dharamshala), India to give a lecture about 'The Art of Saturation'. The lecture focused on one of my favorite analog instruments I was traveling with: [Rytm](https://www.elektron.se/products/analog-rytm-mkii/) and [Heat](https://www.elektron.se/products/analog-heat-mkii/).

Thank you Rahul and team for the wonderful host!
