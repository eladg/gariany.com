## About

Hi there! I'm Elad Gariany (pronounced El-lAd Gari-ya-ni), born and raised in the greater Tel Aviv area in the late 80's. I am a software engineer, entrepreneur and a solution architect with 15+ years of experience, focusing mainly on SaaS in audio/video, streaming and cloud services. I thrive on connecting with people and driving projects forward.

Among my hobbies is hiking with my dogs, playing piano and improvisational composition of music production (basically, jamming with machines).

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eladgariany/) or checkout my [Software Engineer CV](/about/Elad.Gariany-SoftwareEngineer.2025.pdf) or my [Engineering Managment CV](/about/Elad.Gariany-EngineeringManagement.2025.pdf) (updated on early 2025).

Please feel free to reach out to me at elad@gariany.com
